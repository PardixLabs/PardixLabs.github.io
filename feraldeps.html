  <h1>FeralDeps</h1>
  <p>
    A local‑first dependency intelligence tool that helps developers understand supply‑chain risk,
    version drift, and long‑term maintainability — without sending code to the cloud.

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      FeralDeps scans projects directly on your machine to map dependency graphs, identify risk hotspots,
      and explain why a dependency matters. It is designed for clarity, not noise.

    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Modern software is built on a deep dependency stack. FeralDeps gives developers a clear view of
      what they rely on and where hidden risk accumulates — before it becomes a problem.
