  <h1>Pardix Labs</h1>
  <p>
    Pardix Labs builds <span class="accent">local-first developer tools</span> focused on understanding dependency risk,
    software supply chains, and long-term maintainability — without forcing code into the cloud.

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      Modern software relies heavily on third-party dependencies, many of which are outdated, poorly maintained,
      or quietly introduce security and stability risks through transitive dependency chains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pardix Labs focuses on tools that help developers <span class="accent">see, understand, and control</span>
      those risks early — locally, transparently, and without unnecessary noise.
    </p>

    <h2>Products</h2>
    <p>
      Pardix Labs is a general software company focused on building practical, developer‑first tools.
      Our first product, <span class="accent">FeralDeps</span>, is currently in active development.
    </p>
    <p>
      FeralDeps is a standalone Java-based application that scans local project directories to analyze
      dependency usage and software supply chain risk.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>• Scans project folders directly on the developer’s machine</li>
      <li>• Detects outdated dependencies and version drift</li>
      <li>• Analyzes both direct and transitive dependencies</li>
      <li>• Highlights potential security and stability risks</li>
      <li>• Provides clear, human-readable explanations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Local‑First</h2>
    <p>
      Many existing tools require uploading source code or dependency manifests to third-party services.
      This introduces friction, privacy concerns, and complexity — especially for students, open-source
      maintainers, and small teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pardix Labs prioritizes a <span class="accent">local-first</span> approach: no accounts, no uploads,
      and no unnecessary infrastructure.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Who It’s For</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>• Student developers learning dependency management</li>
      <li>• Open-source maintainers auditing project health</li>
      <li>• Indie developers and small teams</li>
      <li>• Anyone who wants clarity without enterprise overhead</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>
      Pardix Labs is an early-stage software company currently being developed as part of an academic
      startup lab. The initial focus is on research, prototyping, and validating developer tooling ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      FeralDeps represents the first step in a broader roadmap of tools aimed at improving software
      reliability, security, and maintainability.
